# Exploring Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Medical Image Processing

● Presented the need for GANs to address challenges of data scarcity, modality gaps, and class imbalance in imaging       
● Analyzed 7 different GAN architectures for medical image synthesis, translation, augmentation and segmentation           
● Developed a proof-of-concept model with stable adversarial training over 50 epochs to generate synthetic data
